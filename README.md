### Terminal Window

### Using the Command Line
[Command Line Tutorial](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl/#/) 

#### Typing cd (or cd ~) — a command for "change directory" — with no parameters takes us to our home directory:
cd <br>
cd ~

#### Change the current directory (folder) (i.e., navigate to directory (folder) of choice):
cd ~/Desktop/

#### List directory (folder) contents:
ls

#### Make directories (folders):
mkdir example_folder

#### Change the current directory (folder) (i.e., navigate to new folder):
cd example_folder/

#### Print the current working directory:
pwd

#### Create a file (e.g., a text file; could be something different like Jupyter Notebook?????):
touch cat.txt <br>
touch dog.txt <br>
touch bird.txt <br>
touch fish.txt

#### Remove directory (folder) entries (files):
rm cat.txt

#### Using Wildcards:
*List any file with "i" in the file name* <br>
ls *i*

*Remove any file with "d"* <br>
rm *d*

#### File pattern searcher (e.g., find all files with the word “the” inside):
grep -r “the” *

#### Find utility (e.g., find all Jupyter Notebook files within subdirectories of the current working directory):
find . | grep ipynb


### Introduction to Git
[Git Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) 

cd ~/Desktop <br>
mkdir hello-world <br>
cd hello-world <br>

#### Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one:
git init <br>
ls -A

#### Create a file:
touch a.txt

#### Show the working tree status:
git status

#### Add file contents to the index:
git add a.txt <br>
git status

#### Record changes to the repository (-m for including log message):
git commit -m "Please remember this file at this time"

#### Show commit logs:
git log

#### Making and Cloning Repositories <br> Manage the set of tracked repositories ("remotes”):
git remote add origin https://github.com/tweichle/hello-world.git

#### *Pushing to GitHub* <br> Update remote refs along with associated objects (i.e., send files from local machine to remote repository on GitHub):
git push -u origin master

#### Create a README.md file:
nano README.md
git add README.md
git status
git commit -m "New README.md"
git push -u origin master

#### *Pulling from GitHub* <br> Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch:
git pull origin master

#### Clone a repository into a new directory
git clone https://github.com/github-username/hello-world.git


#### These are common Git commands used in various situations:
git help
